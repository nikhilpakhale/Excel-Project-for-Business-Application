Created a **Project Priority Matrix** and **Scenario Planning Tool** in Excel by considering hypothetical projects and priority values for creating the matrix, and sales figures for the scenario planning tool.

While executing this project, I learned about Feasibility Matrix and to calculate the best or worst case Scenario based on few Financial parameters.

Thank you Team Codebasics, Dhaval sir and Hemanand sir for the guidance via the bootcamp.
